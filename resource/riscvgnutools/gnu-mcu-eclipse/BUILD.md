# GNU MCU Eclipse RISC-V Embedded GCC build

This package was build on a pair of Debian 8 32/64-bits Docker containers,
running on an OS X machine, using the script provided in the GNU MCU Eclipse
[riscv-gcc-build.git](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-gcc-build) 
project.

## How to build?

To build the latest version of the package please use the script from:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build.git \
~/Downloads/riscv-none-gcc-build.git
```

To run it, first be sure that the packages required in the Prerequisites 
section are installed, then download the script and execute it with bash:

```console
$ bash ~/Downloads/riscv-none-gcc-build.git/scripts/build.sh --linux32 --linux64
```

The output of the build script are two `.tgz` files in the 
`${WORK_FOLDER}/deploy` folder.

The script was developed on OS X 10.12 with Homebrew, but also runs
on most GNU/Linux distributions supporting Docker.
